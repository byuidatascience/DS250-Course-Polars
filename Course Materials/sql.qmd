### Learn How to Setup SQLite

Review the set-up instructions as well in preparation for class.

[SQLite](/Setup/sql_setup.qmd) 


There are many [flavors of SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database#Database_management_system) but most flavors have the same base commands. SQL queries are typed in the following pattern;

```SQL
SELECT -- <columns> and <column calculations>
FROM -- <table name>
  JOIN -- <table name>
  ON -- <columns to join>
WHERE -- <filter condition on rows>
GROUP BY -- <subsets for column calculations>
HAVING -- <filter conditions on groups>
ORDER BY -- <how the output is returned in sequence>
LIMIT -- <number of rows to return>
```

The reading for this task are from this excellent [SQL Guide](https://docs.data.world/documentation/sql/concepts/basic/intro.html). To prepare for class and this task you should read:

- All the categories in the "Basic" group. (topics are grouped in the menu on the left side of the page).
- The following sections in the Intermediate group:
    
    - [Aggregations](https://docs.data.world/documentation/sql/concepts/intermediate/aggregations.html)
    - [GROUP BY and FILTER](https://docs.data.world/documentation/sql/concepts/intermediate/GROUP_BY.html)
    - [HAVING](https://docs.data.world/documentation/sql/concepts/intermediate/HAVING.html)
