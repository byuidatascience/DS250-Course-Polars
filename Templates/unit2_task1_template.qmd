## QUESTION 1

__Write an SQL query that provides playerID, yearID, and batting average for players with at least 1 at bat that year. Sort the table from highest batting average to lowest, and then by playerid alphabetically. Show the top 5 results in your report.__

__Describe your results and analysis here_

```{python}
# Include and execute your code here

# The code below can serve as a template for all the rest of your queries. It is just missing the
# SQL code. Put your SQL query in between the triple quotation marks to create the query. The records will be stored in 'results', which is a polars data frame

q = """

    """
results = pl.read_database(q, con)
results


```


## QUESTION 2

__Use the same query as above, but only include players with at least 10 at bats that year. Print the top 5 results.__

## QUESTION 3

__Now calculate the batting average for players over their entire careers (all years combined). Only include players with at least 100 at bats over their entire career, and print the top 5 results.__
