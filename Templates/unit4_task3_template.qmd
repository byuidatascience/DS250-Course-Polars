## QUESTION 1

__Create 2-3 charts that evaluate the relationships between each of the top 2 or 3 most important variables (as found in Unit 4 Task 2) and the year the home was built.__ Describe what you learn from the charts about how that variable is related to year built.   

_type your write-up and analysis here_

```{python}
# Include and execute your code here


```


## QUESTION 2

__Create at least one other chart to examine a variable(s) you thought might be important but apparently was not. The chart should show its relationship to the year built.__ Describe what you learn from the chart about how that variable is related to year built. Explain why you think it was not (very) important in the model.
