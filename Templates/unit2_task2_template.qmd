## QUESTION 1

__Write an SQL query that pulls in the batting table. Then, with Python Polars code create a dataframe that contains playerID, yearID, and batting average for players with at least 10 at bat that year. Sort the dataframe from highest batting average to lowest, and then by playerid alphabetically. Show the top 5 results in your report.__

_type your results and analysis here_

```{python}
# Include and execute your code here

# The code below can serve as a template for all the rest of your queries. It is just missing the
# SQL code. Put your SQL query in between the triple quotation marks to create the query. The records will be stored in 'results'


q = """

    """
results = pl.read_database(q, con)
results

```


## QUESTION 2

__Write an SQL query that pulls in the batting table. Then, with Python Polars calculate the batting average for each player over their entire career (all years combined). Only include players with at least 100 at bats over their entire career. Sort the dataframe from highest batting average to lowest, and then by playerid alphabetically. Show the top 5 results in your report.__
